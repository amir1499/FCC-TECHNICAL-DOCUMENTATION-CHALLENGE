          <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
          <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
          <p>Guido van  began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.</p>
<p>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

        <article>
        <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including meta-programming and meta-objects [magic methods] ).</p>
        <p>Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.</p>
        <p>s core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
          <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
          <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
          <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
          <li>Readability counts.</li>

        <header>Syntax and semantics</header>
        <article>
        <p>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.</p>
        
          <h4>Indentation</h4>
          <p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.</p>
          <h4>Statements and control flow</h4>
          <p>Python's statements include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =</li>
            <li>The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if)</li>
            <li>The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block</li>
            <li>The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true</li>
            <li>The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups); it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits</li>
            <li>The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception</li>
            <li>The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming</li>
            <li>The def statement, which defines a function or method</li>
            <li>he with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization -like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom</li>
            <li>The break statement, which exits a loop</li>
            <li>The continue statement, which skips the current iteration and continues with the next</li>
            <li>The del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined</li>
            <li>The pass statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block</li>
            <li>The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Expressions</h4>
          <p>Some Python expressions are similar to those in languages such as C and Java, while some are not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division. Python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation.</li>
            <li>The @ infix operator. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.</li>
            <li>The syntax :=, called the "walrus operator", was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.</li>
            <li>In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <= c.</li>
            <li>Python uses and, or, and not as boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! in Java and C.</li>
            <li>Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).</li>
            <li>Python has a "string format" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in C—e.g. "spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2) evaluates to "spam=blah eggs=2". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. "spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2). Python 3.6 added "f-strings": spam = "blah"; eggs = 2; f'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}'.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Methods</h4>
          <p>Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby).</p>
          <h4>Typing</h4>
          <p>Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.</p>
          <h4>Arithmetic operations</h4>
          <p>Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator @ . These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).</p>

        <p>Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.

Python also comes with an Integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is more beginner-oriented.

Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting.</p>

              <p>Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van  enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the meta syntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.</p>
              <p>The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Py game, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python.</p>
